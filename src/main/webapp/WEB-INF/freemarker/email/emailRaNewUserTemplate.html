            This is a request for a PERSONAL certificate, the user must come to you and

            When they do so; 
            <ul>
                <li>Check to your satisfaction that the user is the responsible sysadmin for the 
                    host identified by the Distinguished Name.</li> 
                <li> Check the user's identity, using the photo id.  Don't proceed unless the 
                    photo id is valid and identifies the user.</li>
                <li>Print out the request form.</li>
                <li>Approve the request.</li>
                <li>Take a photo copy of the user's identity document and attach it to the 
                    request form. Store them in a secure place.</li>
