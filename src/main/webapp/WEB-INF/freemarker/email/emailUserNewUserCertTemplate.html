        Dear ${cn},<br/>
        Thank you for requesting a certificate from the UK e-Science CA with Distinguished Name:<br/> 
        [${dn}]<br/>
        <br/>
        Now please go to any one of your Registration Authority operators, bringing:
        <ol>
            <li>Photo id: valid passport (any country), or a UK driver's licence with photo id, or your site's photo id.</li>
            <li>The PIN that you just used.  The RA will ask you for it.  It is to prove that *you* made the request.</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Your Registration Authority operator(s) are: 
        <br/>
        ${raCNs}
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And their last known email addresses:
        <br/>
        ${raEmails}
        <br/>
        Please contact the CA if these RAs are unavailable.<br/> 
        Yours faithfully,<br/>
        CA Operator
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Please note: After your certificate request has been approved, 
        if you get an authentication error when trying to access the portal 
        then the chances are you may have a certificate from our CA that has now <b>expired</b>. 
        To get round this you'll likely have to restart your browser and/or clear your Recent History
        and this time press 'Cancel' if prompted to select your (expired) certificate.
